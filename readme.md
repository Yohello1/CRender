## Building

### Linux


1) To build this project you will require [Intel Rendering Toolkit, specifically Embree 3.0 & Open Image Denoise](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/rendering-toolkit/download.html) (online version), [Intel Threaded Building Blocks](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/tools/oneapi/components/onetbb.html#gs.780vbz), CMake, and `libxi-dev build-essential xorg libglfw3 libglfw3-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev` (these are the packages for Debian/Ubuntu)
2) You will need to run `source /opt/intel/oneapi/setvars.sh` so it sets the global vars needed for building. If this doesn't work please look for this file, and source that file in the same terminal window you compile in.
3) Next you will need to run `cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RELEASE .` this will build the cache
4) Finally you need to build it using `cmake --build . --target CRender`, now this will take a while.
5) Run `./CRender`

#### Bugs/issues with building:
If you get an error such as `./CRender: symbol lookup error: /opt/intel/oneapi/oidn/1.4.0/lib/libOpenImageDenoise.so.1: undefined symbol: _ZN3tbb6detail2r15spawnERNS0_2d14taskERNS2_18task_group_contextE` you need to remove every tbb package except the intel one.
If if you get a `glenable` etc error you need to get new drivers
If it cannot find embree you will need to go to `/opt/intel/oneapi` and move embree to a folder called `embree` instead of `embreeX.XXX`
